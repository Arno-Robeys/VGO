# Assignment

Write a `Person` class so that each `Person`
has a `Name` and an `Age` property.
Both properties are settable and should
satisfy the following validation rules:

* A name must not be `null`, empty or consist exclusively of whitespace.
  Hint: take a look at `string`'s static methods.
* An age must be positive (`>= 0`).
